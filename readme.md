# Tea Time topic

## App.js:

 1. Fetch the data from the Api and return it into string.
 2. I use filter to separate the next topics and the past topics.
 3. I sorted the next topic by ratio: (e.g: 6-3 = 3 and 8-1= 7 so 7 will be before 3).

## FormInput.js:

1. I create the form input in this file and export it to the App file.
  - I have an input and a submit button.

## DiscussedTopic.js:

I built a function for the discussed topics which includes date and delete button.

## UndiscussedTopics.js:

1. I store all the undiscussed topic in this file.
2. Add onClick to the archieve button so that the topics will be in the past topics when it is discussed.
3. Add a delete button to remove the topic from the list.
